# Data Management

Data Management is hard, and before you know it, you can ended up with `final_final_final_project_data-2019.csv.bak` as the source of your project data.

Below is a series of tips, tricks and usecases for managing data throughout the lifecycle of a projects. 


## Reading and Writing Data 
### S3
Our team often uses Amazon S3 as a bucket storage. To access data in S3, you'll have to have AWS access credentials stored at `~/.aws/credentials` per the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html). 

S3 can store anything, of arbitrary object size and shape. It's like a giant folder in the cloud. You can use it to store CSVs, Pickes, Videos, whatever. 

To write and read a pandas dataframe as a CSV to S3: 

```
import pandas as pd
df.to_csv(s3://bucket-name/my_df_name.csv)

pd.read_csv(s3://bucket-name/my_df_name.csv)
```

You can read more in the [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-uploading-files.html) docs. By putting data on S3, anybody on the team can use / access/ and replicate without having to transfer data files between machines. 

### Local Folders 
Sometimes, it is easiest to simply use your local file system to store data. As a manner of conventions, we use the `data` and `processed` directories, which  are automatically ignored from git from the project base `.gitignore`. 

`/data` should be used for raw data, while `/processed` should be used for any intermediate steps. You can also duplicate this on S3. Finally, `outputs/` for outputs. This should all best setup by our [data science template](https://github.com/CityOfLosAngeles/cookiecutter-data-science). If you use `data`, make sure all the data in it is documented in your README. 

Don't hardcode paths, such as `//Users/YOUR_EID/. You might need to use S3 or a cloud database if your data is big. 

### Databases 
Finally, for analysis and storage purposes, it is sometimes best to store the data in a structured database for querying. We use `postgreSQL` for this purposes. 

To access, you'll need to set the $POSTGRES_URI [environment variable](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/share-environment-vars-between-wsl-and-windows/) equal to the proper connection string. Once that is set, you'll be able to read and write SQL queries into dataframes as follows: 

```
import os 
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
import pandas as pd 

connection_string = os.environ.get('POSTGRES_URI')

engine = create_engine(connection_string)

df.to_sql(
    "my_table_name",
    engine,
    schema="public",
    if_exists="replace",
    dtype={"geom": Geometry("POINT", srid=srid)},
)

query = "SELECT * FROM my_table_name LIMIT 10;"

pd.read_sql(query,engine) 

```

Note: This example shows how to make sure that Geometry types are inserted into POSTGIS (a point example) and limits the number of rows returned to 10 in the Query. You can execute abritrary SQL inside `pd.read_sql()`.

## Formats and use-cases 
Data Interchange: Where everything can be broken.

### CSVs 
CSVs are the lowest common denominator of data files. They are plain text files that contain a list of data. Best for getting raw data from SQL and storing large blobs on cloud services. For interchange, it is better to use Parquet or even Excel as they preserve datatypes.

Benefits to CSVs include their readability and ease of use for users. Unlike Parquet files, they are stored as plain text, making them human readable.

The downsides to CSVs are that their sizes can easily get out of hand, making Parquet files a preferable alternative in that regard. CSVs also don't store data types for columns. If there are different data types within a single column, this can lead to numerous isses. For example, if there are  strings and integers mixed within a single column, the process of analyzing that CSV becomes extremely difficult and even impossible at times. Finally, another key issue with CSVs is the ability to only store a single sheet in a file without any formatting or formulas. Excel files do a better job of allowing for formulas and different formats.


### Excel / XLSX

Excel/XLSX is a binary file format that holds information about all the worksheets in a file, including both content and formatting. This means Excel files are capable of holding formatting, images, charts, forumlas, etc. CSVs are more limited in this respect. A downside to Excel files are that they aren't commonly readable by data analsysis platform. Every data analysis platform is capable of processing CSVs, but Excel files are a proprietary format that often require extensions in order to be processed. The ease of processing CSVs makes it easier to move data between different platforms than with Excel files. Excel files are best for sharing with other teams, except for geographic info (use Shapefiles or GeoJSON instead), if the Excel format is the only available and accessible format.

You often might want to write multiple dataframes to a single excel files as sheets. Here's a guide: 

```
## init a writer 
writer = pd.ExcelWriter('../outputs/filename.xlsx', engine='xlsxwriter')

## assume district_dfs is a list of dataframes by council district 
Write each dataframe to a different worksheet.
for key, value in district_dfs.items(): 
    value.to_excel(writer, sheet_name=key)

# Close the Pandas Excel writer and output the Excel file.
writer.save()
```

### Parquet 
Parquet is an "open source columnar storage format for use in data analysis systems." Columnar storage is more efficient as it is  easily compressed and the data is more homogenous. CSV files utilize a row-based storage format which is harder to compress, a reason why Parquets files are preferable for larger datasets. Parquet files are faster to read than CSVs, as they have a higher querying speed and preserve datatypes (ie, Number,  Timestamps, Points). They are best for intermediate data storage and large datasets (1GB+) on most any on-disk storage. This file format is also good for passing dataframes between Python and R. A similar option is [feather](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/03/29/feather/).

One of the downsides to Parquet files is the inability to quickly look at the dataset in GUI based (Excel, QGIS, etc.) programs. Parquet files also lack built-in support for categorical data.

Here is a way to use pandas to convert a local CSV file to a Parquet file:

```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('Physical_Activity_18__Over_20112012.csv')
df2 = df.to_parquet('Physical_Activity.parquet')
```

### Feather Files
Feather provides a lightweight binary columnar serialization format for data frames. It is designed to make reading and writing data frames more efficient, as well as to make sharing data across languages easier. Just like Parquet, Feather is also capable of passing dataframes between Python and R, as well as storing column data types. 

The Feather format is not compressed, allowing for faster input/output so it works well with solid-state drives. Similarly, Feather doesn't need unpacking in order to load it back into RAM. 

Feather is not be the ideal file format if you're looking for long-term data storage. It is really only equipped for short-term data storage. The Feather files themselves are also smaller than CSVs and have a higher input/output speed, but they don't necessarily have the same level of compression as Parquet files. 

Once you install the feather package with `$ pip install feather-format` then you can easily write a dataframe.

```
import feather
path = 'my_data.feather'
feather.write_dataframe(df, path)
df = feather.read_dataframe(path)
```

### GeoJSON:
GeoJSON is an [open-standard format](https://geojson.org/) for encoding a variety of geographic data structures usin JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)  A GeoJSON object may represent a region of space (a Geometry), a spatially bounded entity (a Feature), or a list of Features (a FeatureCollection). It supports geometry types: Point, LineString, Polygon, MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon, and GeometryCollection. JSON is light and easier to read than most geospatial formats, but GeoJSON files can quickly get too large to handle. The upside is that a GeoJSON file is often easier to work with than a Shapefile.

### Shapefiles 
Shapefiles are a geospatial vector data format for geographic information system software and the original file format for geospatial data. They are capable of spatially describing vector features: points, lines, and polygons. Geopandas has good support for reading / writing shapefiles. 

One weird thing, however, is that a shapefile isn't a _file_, it's a _folder_, containing multiple subfiles (such as .dbf, .shpx, etc). To properly read/write shapefiles, make sure to read the entire folder or write to a folder each time. This can cause issues especially as most shapefiles are compressed into a zip file with isn't always easily decompressed. 

It is often better to use `geojson` vs `shapefiles` since the former is easier to render on the web. The latter is better when you have a bespoke projection. A few downsides to shapefiles include their inability to store topolgical information and the file size restriction of 2GB. Similarly, shapefiles can only contain one geometry type per file. 

Here is a template for one way to read and write shapefiles using pandas:
```
import geopandas as gpd 
import os

# read shapefile 
gpd.read_file('./my_folder/')

# write shapefile 
if not os.path.exists('./outputs/my_dir_name'):
    os.mkdirs('./outputs/my_dir_name')
gdf.to_file('./outputs/my_dir_name')
```

### PBF (Protocolbuffer Binary Format):
Protocol Buffers is a method of serializing structured data. It is used for storing and interchanging structured information of all types. PBF involves an interface description language that describes the structure of some data and a program that generates source code from that description for generating or parsing a stream of bytes that represents the structured data. As compared to XML, it is designed to be simpler and quicker. A benefit of using PBF is that you can define how you want your data to be structured once and then use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams. It is also possible to update the defined data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the older structure/format. Although PBF was designed as a better medium for communication between systems than XML, it only has some marginal advantages when compared to JSON.

### Databases 
A whole field of study, it is often useful to use a DB for analytics and aggegrated queries, rather than just your production datastore. Our team maintains a Postgresql + PostGIS DB to help us make complex spatial + geospatial queries. However, it is best practice to move those queries to python or a `Makefile` ASAP. 

### Pickles
A way of serializing arbitrary python objects into a byte stream with the intent of storing it in a file/database. Danger lives here.
